# Neovim Config

This is a personal development environment that prioritizes effiency through personalization. I have been working on this configuration for a good 2 years and it is still being edited and updated. Through this project, I have learned how to build features for my wants and needs which helped me learned how to build tools and scripts in order to increase my productivity.
